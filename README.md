# DCS-Syria

Save the file in \DCS World\Mods\terrains\Syria

* Note: this file is not IC compatible, so save a backup copy of your original Beacons.lua for use on multiplayer servers that enforce IC.

General info:
* I have added ICLS beacons for the F/A-18C for all runways that are already equipped with regular ILS.
* There are TACANs colocated with all glidepath beacons, giving slant range to the touchdown point. Ideally these should be DMEs as in real life, but for some reason the DME beacon type in DCS doesn't work correctly in TACAN equipped aircraft.
